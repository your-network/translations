Saving time and money","Creating content and integrating content in your webshop is expensive and extremely time-consuming. Managing this content with PIM-systems is hard and requires technical knowledge. With content streaming, time and money are saved, leaving you with more time for other important tasks related to your webshop","2. No content storage","Content storage and maintaining content require knowledge and is expensive. In contrast to purchasing product content, content streaming does not confer ownership of the content. As a result, there is no need to handle or maintain large files with product content, leading to reducing costs for content storage or specialized employees in content storage.","3. New products, new assortiment","By adding new products to your store, our system automatically updates the content for these items. As a result, you are relieved from the task of writing new product content every time you acquire new items. This guarantees that potential customers are consistently provided with the most accurate and up-to-date product information."]},{"question":"What are the costs to stream product content?","answer":["Our product content comes with a free plan that is available to all retailers. This plan provides basic product content features and benefits, allowing you to access high-quality product content from top brand manufacturers at no cost.","However, we also offer paid plans that come with exclusive benefits and additional features, as shown in the above pricing model","With our paid plans, retailers can enjoy enhanced functionalities, priority customer support, advanced optimisation, and more. These upgraded plans are designed to cater to your specific needs and help you achieve even greater success in your business.","Rest assured that whether you choose the free plan or one of our paid plans, we are committed to providing exceptional service and support to all our valued retailers.","Feel free to reach out to our team at <a href='mailto:team@your.io'>team@your.io</a> if you have any questions or if you'd like to explore the benefits of our paid plans in more detail."]},{"question":"Which product content categories and languages are available to stream?","answer":["We've worked collaboratively with brand manufacturers, creators, and AI to build a product content database where diversity meets accessibility. We take great pride in presenting an unparalleled collection that encompasses every language in the world (60+) and spans all conceivable categories, from electronics and fashion to furniture, toys, and much more.","But that's not all - we believe in the power of community engagement and user participation. That's why we've also integrated user-generated content into our database. Our platform allows users to contribute their reviews, feedback, and even create product content in their preferred languages. By harnessing the collective knowledge and experiences of our users, we foster a vibrant community that enriches the database with valuable insights and perspectives."]},{"question":"How does the matching process occur between the products in my webshop and the product content provided by YOUR?","answer":["This guide will help you understand the essential product identifiers we use to match your products accurately with product information. Two key product identifiers are at the heart of our process:","<b>1. MPN</b>","<i>MPN - Manufacturer Part Number</i>","<ul><li>MPN, short for Manufacturer Part Number, is a unique alphanumeric code issued by manufacturers to identify their individual products.</li><li>You will typically find MPNs on product barcodes as manufacturers print them alongside the barcode.</li><li>For instance: MHGP3ZD/A (<a href='https://your.io/demo/sdk?matchId=0194252030202&lang=en'>product example</a>).</li></ul>","<b>2. GTIN / EAN</b>","<i>GTIN - Global Trade Item Number</i>","<ul><li>GTIN, which stands for Global Trade Item Number, is a globally recognized product identifier.</li><li>Types of GTINs: The length of a GTIN depends on the product type and the location where the product is sold. You may find the following GTINs:<ul><li>UPC (in North America / GTIN-12): 12-digit number (8-digit UPC-E codes must be converted to 12-digit UPC-A codes.)</li><li>EAN (in Europe / GTIN-13): 13-digit number</li><li>JAN (in Japan / GTIN-13): 8 or 13 digit number</li><li>ISBN (for books): 13-digit number (ISBN-10 values must be converted to ISBN-13)</li><li>ITF-14 (for multipacks/GTIN-14): 14-digit number</li></ul></li><li>You can locate the GTIN displayed next to the barcode on the product's packaging or book cover.</li><li>For example: 0194252030202 (product example)</li>","<b>Proper use of MPN and EAN</b>","<ul><li>It's vital to use the correct MPN and/or EAN for each product to ensure precise identification and matching.<p><i>*Important note: please provide this identifier within the 'barcode' Shopify field.</i></p></li><li>In most cases, each variant of a product (varying in colors or sizes) has its own distinct MPN and/or EAN.</li><li>An important exception to this rule is with different sizes of apparel products, as they often share the same MPN.</li></ul>","Thank you for taking the time to familiarize yourself with our product identification process. By correctly utilizing GTIN and MPN, you play a key role in maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of the product content such as descriptions, videos and photos for your products.","Your shop's integration via Shopify communicates directly with our system to retrieve available product content, providing accurate and up-to-date information for your customers."]},{"question":"Is it necessary to integrate “YOUR” for each product/brand separately?","answer":["No, a single integration (15-30 minutes) on the product detail page template covers the entire shop and every product from all manufacturers. When new suppliers adopt “YOUR”, their product profiles become instantly available in the shop without requiring any additional effort."]},{"question":"Does streaming product affect a retailer's SEO?","answer":["No, “YOUR” does not impact the retailer's SEO (Search Engine Optimisation). This means that how well the shop's website shows up in search engine results won't be affected by “YOUR”. The product profiles are stored in “YOUR” cloud and then inserted into the retailer's shop using a special frame called an iframe.","Therefore, “YOUR” doesn't interfere with the way the shop's website appears to search engines, ensuring that its visibility and ranking in search results remain unaffected."]},{"question":"If streaming product content has no impact on SEO, how can I still optimize my website for search engines?","answer":["You can continue to improve how your shop shows up on Google by using the right keywords for better search results. Additionally, you have the option to create filters for searches within your shop, like you normally would."]},{"question":"Does streaming product content negatively affect the performance of the shop?","answer":["Absolutely not. YOUR is subsequently loaded in your shop, meaning it does not affect the loading time of your shop. Speed is an essential factor, and we've made sure to keep your shop running smoothly."]}]},"ready":{"title":"Ready to improve your products?","usps":["Save costs creating content","Improve conversion rates"],"cta":"Schedule a call"}},"locale":"en"},{"path":"~content/~showcase.json","data":{"seo":{"title":"Take your online store to the next level","description":"Elevate your product pages with the most complete content solution of the world","keywords":""},"intro":{"title":"Take your online store to the next level","cta":"Show full-screen comparison"},"ready":{"title":"Ready to elevate your product pages?","cta":"Get started"},"comparison":{"before":"Before","after":"After","description":{"title":"About the product","all":"Show more"},"image":{"all":"Show all pictures"},"prosCons":{"title":"Pros and cons","all":"Show all pros and cons"},"reasonsToBuy":{"all":"Show more"},"review":{"title":"Reviews"}}},"locale":"en"},{"path":"~content/~privacy.json","data":{"seo":{"title":"Privacy Policy","description":"","keywords":""}},"locale":"en"},{"path":"~content/~pricing.json","data":{"seo":{"title":"Pricing plans","description":"Elevate your product pages with the most complete content solution of the world","keywords":""},"intro":{"title":"Pricing plans","text":"Benefit from YOUR in 4 ways","usp":["Try before you buy","60+ languages","Support included"]},"ready":{"title":"Ready to elevate your product pages?","cta":"Get started"},"faq":{"title":"Questions & answers"}},"locale":"en"},{"path":"~content/~legacy.json","data":{"seo":{"title":"Earn from what you create","description":"Building the first product content NFT marketplace that allows people to: Create , Own and Earn.

Managing this content with PIM-systems is hard and requires technical knowledge. With content streaming, time and money are saved, leaving you with more time for other important tasks related to your webshop","2. No content storage","Content storage and maintaining content requires knowledge and is expensive. In contrast to purchasing product content, content streaming does not confer ownership of the content.

New products, new assortiment","By adding new products to your store, our system automatically updates the content for these items.

We take great pride in presenting an unparalleled collection that encompasses every language in the world (60+) and spans all conceivable categories, from electronics and fashion to furniture, toys, and much more.","But that's not all - we believe in the power of community engagement and user participation.

Two key product identifiers are at the heart of our process:","<b>1. MPN</b>","<i>MPN - Manufacturer Part Number</i>","<ul><li>MPN, short for Manufacturer Part Number, is a unique alphanumeric code issued by manufacturers to identify their individual products.</li><li>You will typically find MPNs on product barcodes as manufacturers print them alongside the barcode.</li><li>For instance: MHGP3ZD/A (<a href='https://your.io/demo/sdk?matchId=0194252030202&lang=en'>product example</a>).</li></ul>","<b>2. GTIN / EAN</b>","<i>GTIN - Global Trade Item Number</i>","<ul><li>GTIN, which stands for Global Trade Item Number, is a globally recognized product identifier.</li><li>Types of GTINs: The length of a GTIN depends on the product type and the location where the product is sold. You may find the following GTINs:<ul><li>UPC (in North America / GTIN-12): 12-digit number (8-digit UPC-E codes must be converted to 12-digit UPC-A codes.)</li><li>EAN (in Europe / GTIN-13): 13-digit number</li><li>JAN (in Japan / GTIN-13): 8 or 13 digit number</li><li>ISBN (for books): 13-digit number (ISBN-10 values must be converted to ISBN-13)</li><li>ITF-14 (for multipacks/GTIN-14): 14-digit number</li></ul></li><li>You can locate the GTIN displayed next to the barcode on the product's packaging or book cover.</li><li>For example: 0194252030202 (product example)</li>","<b>Proper use of MPN and EAN</b>","<ul><li>It's vital to use the correct MPN and/or EAN for each product to ensure precise identification and matching.<p><i>*Important note: please provide this identifier within the 'barcode' Shopify field.</i></p></li><li>In most cases, each variant of a product (varying in colors or sizes) has its own distinct MPN and/or EAN.</li><li>An important exception to this rule is with different sizes of apparel products, as they often share the same MPN.</li></ul>","Thank you for taking the time to familiarize yourself with our product identification process. By correctly utilizing GTIN and MPN, you play a key role in maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of the product content such as descriptions, videos and photos for your products.","Your shop's integration via Shopify communicates directly with our system to retrieve available product content, providing accurate and up-to-date information for your customers."]},{"question":"Is it necessary to integrate “YOUR” for each product/brand separately?","answer":"No, a single integration (15-30 minutes) on the product detail page template covers the entire shop and every product from all manufacturers. When new suppliers adopt “YOUR”, their product profiles become instantly available in the shop without requiring any additional effort."},{"question":"Does streaming product affect a retailer's SEO?","answer":["No, “YOUR” does not impact the retailer's SEO (Search Engine Optimization). This means that how well the shop's website shows up in search engine results won't be affected by 'YOUR.' The product profiles are stored in “YOUR” cloud and then inserted into the retailer's shop using a special frame called an iframe.","Therefore, “YOUR” doesn't interfere with the way the shop's website appears to search engines, ensuring that its visibility and ranking in search results remain unaffected."]},{"question":"If streaming product content has no impact on SEO, how can I still optimize my website for search engines?","answer":"You can continue to improve how your shop shows up on Google by using the right keywords for better search results. Additionally, you have the option to create filters for searches within your shop, like you normally would."},{"question":"Does streaming product content negatively affect the performance of the shop?","answer":"Absolutely not.

Saving time and money","Creating content and integrating content in your webshop is expensive and extremely time-consuming. Managing this content with PIM-systems is hard and requires technical knowledge. With content streaming, time and money are saved, leaving you with more time for other important tasks related to your webshop","2. No content storage","Content storage and maintaining content require knowledge and is expensive. In contrast to purchasing product content, content streaming does not confer ownership of the content. As a result, there is no need to handle or maintain large files with product content, leading to reducing costs for content storage or specialized employees in content storage.","3. New products, new assortiment","By adding new products to your store, our system automatically updates the content for these items. As a result, you are relieved from the task of writing new product content every time you acquire new items. This guarantees that potential customers are consistently provided with the most accurate and up-to-date product information."]},{"question":"What are the costs to stream product content?","answer":["Our product content comes with a free plan that is available to all retailers. This plan provides basic product content features and benefits, allowing you to access high-quality product content from top brand manufacturers at no cost.","However, we also offer paid plans that come with exclusive benefits and additional features, as shown in the above pricing model","With our paid plans, retailers can enjoy enhanced functionalities, priority customer support, advanced optimisation, and more.

We take great pride in presenting an unparalleled collection that encompasses every language in the world (60+) and spans all conceivable categories, from electronics and fashion to furniture, toys, and much more.","But that's not all - we believe in the power of community engagement and user participation. That's why we've also integrated user-generated content into our database. Our platform allows users to contribute their reviews, feedback, and even create product content in their preferred languages. By harnessing the collective knowledge and experiences of our users, we foster a vibrant community that enriches the database with valuable insights and perspectives."]},{"question":"How does the matching process occur between the products in my webshop and the product content provided by YOUR?","answer":["This guide will help you understand the essential product identifiers we use to match your products accurately with product information. Two key product identifiers are at the heart of our process:","<b>1. MPN</b>","<i>MPN - Manufacturer Part Number</i>","<ul><li>MPN, short for Manufacturer Part Number, is a unique alphanumeric code issued by manufacturers to identify their individual products.</li><li>You will typically find MPNs on product barcodes as manufacturers print them alongside the barcode.</li><li>For instance: MHGP3ZD/A (<a href='https://your.io/demo/sdk?matchId=0194252030202&lang=en'>product example</a>).</li></ul>","<b>2. GTIN / EAN</b>","<i>GTIN - Global Trade Item Number</i>","<ul><li>GTIN, which stands for Global Trade Item Number, is a globally recognized product identifier.</li><li>Types of GTINs: The length of a GTIN depends on the product type and the location where the product is sold. You may find the following GTINs:<ul><li>UPC (in North America / GTIN-12): 12-digit number (8-digit UPC-E codes must be converted to 12-digit UPC-A codes.)</li><li>EAN (in Europe / GTIN-13): 13-digit number</li><li>JAN (in Japan / GTIN-13): 8 or 13 digit number</li><li>ISBN (for books): 13-digit number (ISBN-10 values must be converted to ISBN-13)</li><li>ITF-14 (for multipacks/GTIN-14): 14-digit number</li></ul></li><li>You can locate the GTIN displayed next to the barcode on the product's packaging or book cover.</li><li>For example: 0194252030202 (product example)</li>","<b>Proper use of MPN and EAN</b>","<ul><li>It's vital to use the correct MPN and/or EAN for each product to ensure precise identification and matching.<p><i>*Important note: please provide this identifier within the 'barcode' Shopify field.</i></p></li><li>In most cases, each variant of a product (varying in colors or sizes) has its own distinct MPN and/or EAN.</li><li>An important exception to this rule is with different sizes of apparel products, as they often share the same MPN.</li></ul>","Thank you for taking the time to familiarize yourself with our product identification process. By correctly utilizing GTIN and MPN, you play a key role in maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of the product content such as descriptions, videos and photos for your products.","Your shop's integration via Shopify communicates directly with our system to retrieve available product content, providing accurate and up-to-date information for your customers."]},{"question":"Is it necessary to integrate “YOUR” for each product/brand separately?","answer":["No, a single integration (15-30 minutes) on the product detail page template covers the entire shop and every product from all manufacturers. When new suppliers adopt “YOUR”, their product profiles become instantly available in the shop without requiring any additional effort."]},{"question":"Does streaming product affect a retailer's SEO?","answer":["No, “YOUR” does not impact the retailer's SEO (Search Engine Optimisation). This means that how well the shop's website shows up in search engine results won't be affected by “YOUR”. The product profiles are stored in “YOUR” cloud and then inserted into the retailer's shop using a special frame called an iframe.","Therefore, “YOUR” doesn't interfere with the way the shop's website appears to search engines, ensuring that its visibility and ranking in search results remain unaffected."]},{"question":"If streaming product content has no impact on SEO, how can I still optimize my website for search engines?","answer":["You can continue to improve how your shop shows up on Google by using the right keywords for better search results. Additionally, you have the option to create filters for searches within your shop, like you normally would."]},{"question":"Does streaming product content negatively affect the performance of the shop?","answer":["Absolutely not.

Saving time and money","Creating content and integrating content in your webshop is expensive and extremely time-consuming. Managing this content with PIM-systems is hard and requires technical knowledge. With content streaming, time and money are saved, leaving you with more time for other important tasks related to your webshop","2. No content storage","Content storage and maintaining content requires knowledge and is expensive. In contrast to purchasing product content, content streaming does not confer ownership of the content. As a result, there is no need to handle or maintain large files with product content, leading to reducing costs for content storage or specialized employees in content storage.","3. New products, new assortiment","By adding new products to your store, our system automatically updates the content for these items.

We take great pride in presenting an unparalleled collection that encompasses every language in the world (60+) and spans all conceivable categories, from electronics and fashion to furniture, toys, and much more.","But that's not all - we believe in the power of community engagement and user participation.

Our platform allows users to contribute their reviews, feedback, and even create product content in their preferred languages. By harnessing the collective knowledge and experiences of our users, we foster a vibrant community that enriches the database with valuable insights and perspectives."]},{"question":"How does the matching process occur between the products in my webshop and the product content provided by YOUR?","answer":["This guide will help you understand the essential product identifiers we use to match your products accurately with product information. Two key product identifiers are at the heart of our process:","<b>1. MPN</b>","<i>MPN - Manufacturer Part Number</i>","<ul><li>MPN, short for Manufacturer Part Number, is a unique alphanumeric code issued by manufacturers to identify their individual products.</li><li>You will typically find MPNs on product barcodes as manufacturers print them alongside the barcode.</li><li>For instance: MHGP3ZD/A (<a href='https://your.io/demo/sdk?matchId=0194252030202&lang=en'>product example</a>).</li></ul>","<b>2. GTIN / EAN</b>","<i>GTIN - Global Trade Item Number</i>","<ul><li>GTIN, which stands for Global Trade Item Number, is a globally recognized product identifier.</li><li>Types of GTINs: The length of a GTIN depends on the product type and the location where the product is sold. You may find the following GTINs:<ul><li>UPC (in North America / GTIN-12): 12-digit number (8-digit UPC-E codes must be converted to 12-digit UPC-A codes.)</li><li>EAN (in Europe / GTIN-13): 13-digit number</li><li>JAN (in Japan / GTIN-13): 8 or 13 digit number</li><li>ISBN (for books): 13-digit number (ISBN-10 values must be converted to ISBN-13)</li><li>ITF-14 (for multipacks/GTIN-14): 14-digit number</li></ul></li><li>You can locate the GTIN displayed next to the barcode on the product's packaging or book cover.</li><li>For example: 0194252030202 (product example)</li>","<b>Proper use of MPN and EAN</b>","<ul><li>It's vital to use the correct MPN and/or EAN for each product to ensure precise identification and matching.<p><i>*Important note: please provide this identifier within the 'barcode' Shopify field.</i></p></li><li>In most cases, each variant of a product (varying in colors or sizes) has its own distinct MPN and/or EAN.</li><li>An important exception to this rule is with different sizes of apparel products, as they often share the same MPN.</li></ul>","Thank you for taking the time to familiarize yourself with our product identification process. By correctly utilizing GTIN and MPN, you play a key role in maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of the product content such as descriptions, videos and photos for your products.","Your shop's integration via Shopify communicates directly with our system to retrieve available product content, providing accurate and up-to-date information for your customers."]},{"question":"Is it necessary to integrate “YOUR” for each product/brand separately?","answer":"No, a single integration (15-30 minutes) on the product detail page template covers the entire shop and every product from all manufacturers. When new suppliers adopt “YOUR”, their product profiles become instantly available in the shop without requiring any additional effort."},{"question":"Does streaming product affect a retailer's SEO?","answer":["No, “YOUR” does not impact the retailer's SEO (Search Engine Optimization). This means that how well the shop's website shows up in search engine results won't be affected by 'YOUR.' The product profiles are stored in “YOUR” cloud and then inserted into the retailer's shop using a special frame called an iframe.","Therefore, “YOUR” doesn't interfere with the way the shop's website appears to search engines, ensuring that its visibility and ranking in search results remain unaffected."]},{"question":"If streaming product content has no impact on SEO, how can I still optimize my website for search engines?","answer":"You can continue to improve how your shop shows up on Google by using the right keywords for better search results. Additionally, you have the option to create filters for searches within your shop, like you normally would."},{"question":"Does streaming product content negatively affect the performance of the shop?","answer":"Absolutely not.

节省时间和金钱","创作内容并将其集成到您的网店中是一项既昂贵又耗时的工作。使用产品信息管理系统（PIM）来管理这些内容也相当复杂，并且需要具备一定的技术知识。然而，通过采用内容流式传输的方法，您不仅可以节省大量的时间和金钱，还能腾出更多时间来处理与网店运营相关的其他关键任务。","2. 无需内容存储","存储和维护内容需要专业知识和高昂的成本。与购买产品内容不同，内容流式传输不涉及内容所有权的转移。这意味着您无需处理或维护大型产品内容文件，从而降低了内容存储的成本。","3. 新产品，新组合","通过将新产品添加到商店，我们的系统能够自动更新这些项目的相关信息。这意味着，您无需在每次获取新物品时重新编写产品内容。这确保了潜在客户始终能够获得最准确、最新的产品信息。"]},{"question":"流式传输产品内容的费用是多少？","answer":["我们的产品内容提供免费计划，适用于所有零售商。这个计划为您提供了基本的产品内容功能和优势，让您能够免费访问来自顶级品牌制造商的高质量产品内容。","当然，我们也提供付费计划。这个付费计划包含独家优惠和额外功能，如上述定价计划所示。","选择我们的付费计划后，零售商将享受到增强的功能、优先的客户支持以及高级优化等权益。这些升级计划专为您的特定需求而设计，旨在助力您在业务领域取得更大的成功。","不论您选择免费计划还是付费计划，我们都始终致力于为每一位重要的零售商提供卓越的服务和支持。","如果您有任何问题，或者想详细了解我们付费计划的优势，请随时通过<a

MPN</b>","<i>MPN - 制造商零件号</i>","<ul><li>制造商零件号（MPN）是制造商为每个产品分配的唯一字母数字代码，用于准确识别不同的产品。</li><li>您通常可以在产品的条形码上找到这个MPN，因为它会被印刷在条形码的旁边。</li><li>例如：MHGP3ZD/A (<a href='https://your.io/demo/sdk?matchId=0194252030202&lang=en'>产品示例</a>).</li></ul>","<b>2. GTIN / EAN</b>","<i>GTIN - 全球交易品项识别代码</i>","<ul><li>全球交易品项识别代码（GTIN）是一个全球认可的产品标识代码。</li><li>GTIN的类型：GTIN的长度取决于产品类型和产品销售地点。以下是您可能会遇到的不同类型的GTIN：<ul><li>UPC（在北美/

GTIN-14）：14位数字</li></ul></li><li>您可以在产品包装或书籍封面上的条形码旁找到GTIN。</li><li>例如：0194252030202（产品示例）</li>","<b>正确使用MPN和EAN</b>","<ul><li>为了确保产品的精确识别和匹配，为每个产品提供正确的制造商零件号（MPN）和/或欧洲商品编号（EAN）至关重要。<p><i>*请注意，您应在Shopify的“条形码”字段中提供这些标识符，以确保我们的系统能够准确识别您的产品。</i></p></li><li>在大多数情况下，同一产品的不同变体（如颜色或尺寸不同）都会有其独特的MPN和/或EAN。</li><li>然而，服装产品是一个重要的例外：不同尺寸的同一款服装通常共享相同的MPN。</li></ul>","感谢您抽出时间熟悉我们的产品标识。通过正确利用GTIN和MPN，您在保证产品内容（如描述、视频和照片）的准确性和效率方面发挥着关键作用。","通过Shopify集成您的店铺后，将能够直接与我们的系统进行通信，从而轻松检索各种可用的产品内容。这样，您就能确保为客户提供准确且最新的产品信息。"]},{"question":"每个产品/品牌都需要单独集成“YOUR”吗？","answer":["您不需要对每个产品进行单独的集成，只需在产品详细页面模板上进行一次集成（大约需要15-30分钟），即可涵盖整个商店以及来自所有制造商的每个产品。当新的供应商选择使用“YOUR”时，他们的产品配置文件将立即出现在商店中，无需付出额外的工作。"]},{"question":"流式产品是否会影响零售商的SEO？","answer":["不会，使用“YOUR”不会对零售商的搜索引擎优化（SEO）造成任何影响。这意味着您的商店网站在搜索引擎结果中的展示效果不会受到“YOUR”的影响。产品配置文件存储在“YOUR”的云端，然后通过一个名为iframe的特殊框架插入到零售商的商店中。","因此，“YOUR”不会干扰商店网站在搜索引擎中的显示方式，从而确保其在搜索结果中的可见性和排名不受影响。"]},{"question":"如果流式产品内容不会对SEO产生影响，我应该如何优化我的网站以便于搜索引擎检索？","answer":["您可以继续优化商店在Google上的显示效果，通过使用恰当的关键词来提升搜索结果。同时，您依然可以像往常一样为商店设置搜索过滤器，以便客户更轻松地找到他们所需的产品。"]},{"question":"流式产品内容是否会对商店的性能产生负面影响？","answer":["绝对不会。YOUR在您的商店中是作为后续加载项加载的，这意味着它不会影响商店的加载时间。速度对于用户体验至关重要，因此我们始终确保您的商店运行流畅。"]}]},"ready":{"title":"准备改进您的产品？","usps":["节省创作内容的成本","提高转化率"],"cta":"预约通话"}},"locale":"zh"},{"path":"~content/~legacy.json","data":{"seo":{"title":"从您所创造的内容中赚取收益","description":"构建第一个产品内容NFT市场，使人们可以：创建、拥有和赚取收益。从您所创造的内容中赚取收益","keywords":""},"intro":{"hash":"简介","headline":"从您所创造的内容中赚取收益","paragraphs":["通过YOUR——NFT市场，以及电子商务和Web3平台，您可以从全球创作者社区直接购买数字和实物产品内容，并为您的数字和实物产品内容获得报酬。"],"buyNow":"立即前往购买：","poweredBy":"技术支持："},"backed":{"hash":"合作伙伴","title":"支持："},"known":{"hash":"新闻媒体报道","headline":"媒体报道："},"mission":{"hash":"使命","title":"我们的使命","headline":"元宇宙和电子商务","paragraphs":["在电子商务和Web3的世界中，产品内容的呈现至关重要。亚马逊、阿里巴巴、Sandbox

Two key product identifiers are at the heart of our process:","<b>1. MPN</b>","<i>MPN - Manufacturer Part Number</i>","<ul><li>MPN, short for Manufacturer Part Number, is a unique alphanumeric code issued by manufacturers to identify their individual products.</li><li>You will typically find MPNs on product barcodes as manufacturers print them alongside the barcode.</li><li>For instance: MHGP3ZD/A (<a href='https://your.io/demo/sdk?matchId=0194252030202&lang=en'>product example</a>).</li></ul>","<b>2. GTIN / EAN</b>","<i>GTIN - Global Trade Item Number</i>","<ul><li>GTIN, which stands for Global Trade Item Number, is a globally recognized product identifier.</li><li>Types of GTINs: The length of a GTIN depends on the product type and the location where the product is sold. You may find the following GTINs:<ul><li>UPC (in North America / GTIN-12): 12-digit number (8-digit UPC-E codes must be converted to 12-digit UPC-A codes.)</li><li>EAN (in Europe / GTIN-13): 13-digit number</li><li>JAN (in Japan / GTIN-13): 8 or 13 digit number</li><li>ISBN (for books): 13-digit number (ISBN-10 values must be converted to ISBN-13)</li><li>ITF-14 (for multipacks/GTIN-14): 14-digit number</li></ul></li><li>You can locate the GTIN displayed next to the barcode on the product's packaging or book cover.</li><li>For example: 0194252030202 (product example)</li>","<b>Proper use of MPN and EAN</b>","<ul><li>It's vital to use the correct MPN and/or EAN for each product to ensure precise identification and matching.<p><i>*Important note: please provide this identifier within the 'barcode' Shopify field.</i></p></li><li>In most cases, each variant of a product (varying in colors or sizes) has its own distinct MPN and/or EAN.</li><li>An important exception to this rule is with different sizes of apparel products, as they often share the same MPN.</li></ul>","Thank you for taking the time to familiarize yourself with our product identification process. By correctly utilizing GTIN and MPN, you play a key role in maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of the product content such as descriptions, videos and photos for your products.","Your shop's integration via Shopify communicates directly with our system to retrieve available product content, providing accurate and up-to-date information for your customers."]},{"question":"Is it necessary to integrate “YOUR” for each product/brand separately?","answer":"No, a single integration (15-30 minutes) on the product detail page template covers the entire shop and every product from all manufacturers. When new suppliers adopt “YOUR”, their product profiles become instantly available in the shop without requiring any additional effort."},{"question":"Does streaming product affect a retailer's SEO?","answer":["No, “YOUR” does not impact the retailer's SEO (Search Engine Optimization). This means that how well the shop's website shows up in search engine results won't be affected by 'YOUR.' The product profiles are stored in “YOUR” cloud and then inserted into the retailer's shop using a special frame called an iframe.","Therefore, “YOUR” doesn't interfere with the way the shop's website appears to search engines, ensuring that its visibility and ranking in search results remain unaffected."]},{"question":"If streaming product content has no impact on SEO, how can I still optimize my website for search engines?","answer":"You can continue to improve how your shop shows up on Google by using the right keywords for better search results. Additionally, you have the option to create filters for searches within your shop, like you normally would."},{"question":"Does streaming product content negatively affect the performance of the shop?","answer":"Absolutely not.
