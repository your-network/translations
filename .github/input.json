Two key product identifiers are at the heart of our process:","<b>1. MPN</b>","<i>MPN - Manufacturer Part Number</i>","<ul><li>MPN, short for Manufacturer Part Number, is a unique alphanumeric code issued by manufacturers to identify their individual products.</li><li>You will typically find MPNs on product barcodes as manufacturers print them alongside the barcode.</li><li>For instance: MHGP3ZD/A (<a href='https://your.io/demo/sdk?matchId=0194252030202&lang=en'>product example</a>).</li></ul>","<b>2. GTIN / EAN</b>","<i>GTIN - Global Trade Item Number</i>","<ul><li>GTIN, which stands for Global Trade Item Number, is a globally recognized product identifier.</li><li>Types of GTINs: The length of a GTIN depends on the product type and the location where the product is sold. You may find the following GTINs:<ul><li>UPC (in North America / GTIN-12): 12-digit number (8-digit UPC-E codes must be converted to 12-digit UPC-A codes.)</li><li>EAN (in Europe / GTIN-13): 13-digit number</li><li>JAN (in Japan / GTIN-13): 8 or 13 digit number</li><li>ISBN (for books): 13-digit number (ISBN-10 values must be converted to ISBN-13)</li><li>ITF-14 (for multipacks/GTIN-14): 14-digit number</li></ul></li><li>You can locate the GTIN displayed next to the barcode on the product's packaging or book cover.</li><li>For example: 0194252030202 (product example)</li>","<b>Proper use of MPN and EAN</b>","<ul><li>It's vital to use the correct MPN and/or EAN for each product to ensure precise identification and matching.<p><i>*Important note: please provide this identifier within the 'barcode' product field.</i></p></li><li>In most cases, each variant of a product (varying in colors or sizes) has its own distinct MPN and/or EAN.</li><li>An important exception to this rule is with different sizes of apparel products, as they often share the same MPN.</li></ul>","Thank you for taking the time to familiarize yourself with our product identification process. By correctly utilizing GTIN and MPN, you play a key role in maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of the product content such as descriptions, videos and photos for your products.","Your shop's integration communicates directly with our system to retrieve available product content, providing accurate and up-to-date information for your customers."]},{"question":"Is it necessary to integrate “YOUR” for each product/brand separately?","answer":"No, a single integration (15-30 minutes) on the product detail page template covers the entire shop and every product from all manufacturers. When new suppliers adopt “YOUR”, their product profiles become instantly available in the shop without requiring any additional effort."},{"question":"Does streaming product affect a retailer's SEO?","answer":["No, “YOUR” does not impact the retailer's SEO (Search Engine Optimization). This means that how well the shop's website shows up in search engine results won't be affected by 'YOUR.' The product profiles are stored in “YOUR” cloud and then inserted into the retailer's shop using a special frame called an iframe.","Therefore, “YOUR” doesn't interfere with the way the shop's website appears to search engines, ensuring that its visibility and ranking in search results remain unaffected."]},{"question":"If streaming product content has no impact on SEO, how can I still optimize my website for search engines?","answer":"You can continue to improve how your shop shows up on Google by using the right keywords for better search results. Additionally, you have the option to create filters for searches within your shop, like you normally would."},{"question":"Does streaming product content negatively affect the performance of the shop?","answer":"Absolutely not. YOUR is subsequently loaded in your shop, meaning it does not affect the loading time of your shop.

New products, new assortiment","By adding new products to your store, our system automatically updates the content for these items.

We take great pride in presenting an unparalleled collection that encompasses every language in the world (60+) and spans all conceivable categories, from electronics and fashion to furniture, toys, and much more.","But that's not all - we believe in the power of community engagement and user participation.

Two key product identifiers are at the heart of our process:","<b>1. MPN</b>","<i>MPN - Manufacturer Part Number</i>","<ul><li>MPN, short for Manufacturer Part Number, is a unique alphanumeric code issued by manufacturers to identify their individual products.</li><li>You will typically find MPNs on product barcodes as manufacturers print them alongside the barcode.</li><li>For instance: MHGP3ZD/A (<a href='https://your.io/demo/sdk?matchId=0194252030202&lang=en'>product example</a>).</li></ul>","<b>2. GTIN / EAN</b>","<i>GTIN - Global Trade Item Number</i>","<ul><li>GTIN, which stands for Global Trade Item Number, is a globally recognized product identifier.</li><li>Types of GTINs: The length of a GTIN depends on the product type and the location where the product is sold. You may find the following GTINs:<ul><li>UPC (in North America / GTIN-12): 12-digit number (8-digit UPC-E codes must be converted to 12-digit UPC-A codes.)</li><li>EAN (in Europe / GTIN-13): 13-digit number</li><li>JAN (in Japan / GTIN-13): 8 or 13 digit number</li><li>ISBN (for books): 13-digit number (ISBN-10 values must be converted to ISBN-13)</li><li>ITF-14 (for multipacks/GTIN-14): 14-digit number</li></ul></li><li>You can locate the GTIN displayed next to the barcode on the product's packaging or book cover.</li><li>For example: 0194252030202 (product example)</li>","<b>Proper use of MPN and EAN</b>","<ul><li>It's vital to use the correct MPN and/or EAN for each product to ensure precise identification and matching.<p><i>*Important note: please provide this identifier within the 'barcode' product field.</i></p></li><li>In most cases, each variant of a product (varying in colors or sizes) has its own distinct MPN and/or EAN.</li><li>An important exception to this rule is with different sizes of apparel products, as they often share the same MPN.</li></ul>","Thank you for taking the time to familiarize yourself with our product identification process. By correctly utilizing GTIN and MPN, you play a key role in maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of the product content such as descriptions, videos and photos for your products.","Your shop's integration communicates directly with our system to retrieve available product content, providing accurate and up-to-date information for your customers."]},{"question":"Is it necessary to integrate “YOUR” for each product/brand separately?","answer":"No, a single integration (15-30 minutes) on the product detail page template covers the entire shop and every product from all manufacturers. When new suppliers adopt “YOUR”, their product profiles become instantly available in the shop without requiring any additional effort."},{"question":"Does streaming product affect a retailer's SEO?","answer":["No, “YOUR” does not impact the retailer's SEO (Search Engine Optimization). This means that how well the shop's website shows up in search engine results won't be affected by 'YOUR.' The product profiles are stored in “YOUR” cloud and then inserted into the retailer's shop using a special frame called an iframe.","Therefore, “YOUR” doesn't interfere with the way the shop's website appears to search engines, ensuring that its visibility and ranking in search results remain unaffected."]},{"question":"If streaming product content has no impact on SEO, how can I still optimize my website for search engines?","answer":"You can continue to improve how your shop shows up on Google by using the right keywords for better search results. Additionally, you have the option to create filters for searches within your shop, like you normally would."},{"question":"Does streaming product content negatively affect the performance of the shop?","answer":"Absolutely not. YOUR is subsequently loaded in your shop, meaning it does not affect the loading time of your shop. Speed is an essential factor, and we've made sure to keep your shop running smoothly."}]}}},{"path":"_.json","locale":"zh","data":{"comingSoon":"即将推出","backToWiki":"返回

When new suppliers adopt “YOUR”, their product profiles become instantly available in the shop without requiring any additional effort."},{"question":"Does streaming product affect a retailer's SEO?","answer":["No, “YOUR” does not impact the retailer's SEO (Search Engine Optimization). This means that how well the shop's website shows up in search engine results won't be affected by 'YOUR.'
