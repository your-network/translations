        "answer": "After creators add content to the platform, it first will be curated by the system. In case the product content does not contain the right information that fits the product, is inappropriate to the platform or any other reason to not approve the content, the content will not be accepted to go live on the platform. Once product content is actually approved, the content quality is monitored by curators within our community. To ensure that companies have the choice of the best product content, everyone is able to check, change and improve product content that has been made by other creators earlier."
